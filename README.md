# A curated list of resources on Behringer 2600 synthesizers

As the Behringer 2600s are clones of the ARP 2600s from the 70s, and the same goes for the Korg ARP 2600 FS re-issue, most materials included on this page work for all three, as well as for soft-synths.

If you have resources to add, just send me a PR.
